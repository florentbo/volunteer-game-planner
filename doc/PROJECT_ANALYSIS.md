Here's what I like and what could be improved in this project:

### What I like:

- **Clear Architecture:** The separation of concerns with a database abstraction layer (`IDatabase`) is excellent for testing and maintainability.
- **Strong Testing Culture:** The project is set up for testing from the start, with Vitest, React Testing Library, and a convention for test file location.
- **Code Quality:** The use of ESLint and Prettier ensures consistent code style.
- **Good Documentation:** The existing `CLAUDE.md` provides a solid overview of the project.

### What could be improved:

- **Security:** The hardcoded manager PIN is a security risk and should be managed through environment variables.
- **Test Command:** There isn't a simple, dedicated npm script for running a single test (e.g., `npm run test:single <file>`).
- **Clarity on Mock Data:** The way mock data is handled in production isn't specified. It should be clear that it's disabled in a production build.
